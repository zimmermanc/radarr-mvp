# GitHub Actions Workflow Optimization

**Optimized**: 2025-08-24  
**Strategy**: Smart workflow consolidation with conditional execution  
**Savings**: ~60-70% reduction in GitHub Actions minute usage

## Optimized Workflow Structure

### ðŸ”¨ Build & Quality (`ci.yml`)
**Triggers**: Push/PR to main/develop (code changes only)  
**Consolidates**: Former CI Pipeline + Code Quality + Quick Checks  
**Features**:
- Conditional execution based on file changes
- Skip on documentation-only changes  
- Comprehensive Rust build, test, clippy analysis
- Cross-platform builds only on main branch pushes
- Advanced caching for dependencies and build artifacts

**Estimated Runtime**: 8-12 minutes (vs. 15-20 minutes previously)

### ðŸ”’ Security Scanning (`security.yml`)  
**Triggers**: Code changes, weekly schedule, manual  
**Consolidates**: Former Security Scanning + Secret Detection  
**Features**:
- GitLeaks secret detection
- Cargo audit for dependencies  
- Semgrep SAST analysis
- SBOM generation for supply chain security
- Runs only on security-relevant file changes

**Estimated Runtime**: 6-8 minutes (vs. 10-15 minutes previously)

### ðŸ“‹ PR Validation (`pr-validation.yml`)
**Triggers**: Pull requests only  
**Features**:
- Lightweight PR size and commit message validation
- Basic syntax checking without full builds
- Breaking change detection
- Fast feedback for contributors

**Estimated Runtime**: 2-3 minutes (vs. 5-8 minutes previously)

### ðŸš€ Release (`release.yml`)
**Triggers**: Git tags only  
**Features**: 
- Unchanged cargo-dist release automation
- Cross-platform binary builds
- Installer and Homebrew formula generation

**Estimated Runtime**: 15-20 minutes (unchanged, only on releases)

## Removed Workflows

**Eliminated for Optimization:**
- `quality.yml` â†’ Merged into ci.yml
- `codacy.yml` â†’ External service, high cost, merged metrics into ci.yml  
- `security-gitleaks.yml` â†’ Merged into security.yml
- `badges.yml` â†’ Low value, high frequency, removed

**Backup Location**: `.github/workflows/backup/` (8 original files preserved)

## Usage Optimization Features

### Path-Based Triggers
```yaml
paths-ignore:
  - '**/*.md'      # Skip on documentation changes
  - 'docs/**'      # Skip on docs directory changes
  - 'LICENSE'      # Skip on license changes
  - '.gitignore'   # Skip on gitignore changes
```

### Conditional Job Execution
```yaml
if: needs.quick-checks.outputs.should_run_full == 'true'
```

### Smart Caching Strategy
- **Cargo registry caching** for dependency downloads
- **Build artifact caching** for incremental compilation  
- **Tool caching** for installed binaries (taplo, tokei, etc.)
- **Platform-specific cache keys** for cross-platform builds

### Timeout Protection
- **Quick checks**: 10 minutes maximum
- **Build & test**: 30 minutes maximum  
- **Security scans**: 15 minutes maximum
- **PR validation**: 10 minutes maximum

## Expected Savings

### Before Optimization
- **8 workflows** Ã— 5-6 minutes average = 40-48 minutes per push
- **Daily usage** (20 pushes): 800-960 minutes
- **Monthly projection**: 24,000-28,800 minutes (far exceeding free tier)

### After Optimization  
- **2-3 workflows** Ã— 4-5 minutes average = 8-15 minutes per push
- **Conditional skipping**: 50% of pushes skip heavy workflows
- **Daily usage** (20 pushes): 200-400 minutes  
- **Monthly projection**: 6,000-12,000 minutes (within Pro tier limits)

**Savings**: 60-70% reduction in minute usage while maintaining code quality

## Maintenance and Monitoring

### Usage Monitoring
```bash
# Check workflow runs
gh run list --limit 10

# Monitor minute usage  
gh api user/settings/billing/actions

# Check workflow efficiency
gh workflow list
```

### Cost Control Guidelines
1. **Review workflows monthly** for further optimization opportunities
2. **Monitor minute usage** to stay within GitHub plan limits
3. **Adjust conditional triggers** based on development patterns
4. **Consider self-hosted runners** if usage grows beyond GitHub plan limits

### Quality Assurance
- **Pre-commit hooks** catch formatting issues locally
- **Essential security scanning** maintained  
- **Release automation** unchanged for stability
- **Cross-platform validation** preserved for main branch

## Recovery Procedures

If optimization causes issues:
```bash
# Restore original workflows
cp .github/workflows/backup/*.yml .github/workflows/
git add .github/workflows/ && git commit -m "restore: revert workflow optimization"
```

**Note**: All original workflows preserved in backup directory for easy recovery.
