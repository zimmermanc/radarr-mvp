### 🧪 Frontend Testing Strategy - Design-System-Driven Hybrid (2025-08-24)

**Problem**: Recurring frontend JavaScript errors reaching production without detection
- **Current Issues**: "d is not iterable" errors, WebSocket authentication failures  
- **Root Cause**: No browser-based testing - only backend API testing exists
- **Solution**: Comprehensive testing infrastructure with fast feedback loops

**Selected Approach**: Design-System-Driven Hybrid Testing Stack
- **Unit/Component**: Vitest + React Testing Library (fast feedback for most changes)
- **Design System**: Storybook + @storybook/test-runner (living design system with visual guards)
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright (Chromium/Firefox/WebKit for high confidence user flows)
- **Data Safety**: MSW (HTTP mocks), mock-socket (WebSocket), Zod (runtime schemas)
- **Visual Regression**: Chromatic or Playwright screenshots for design consistency
- **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions with required testing gates

**Implementation Timeline**:
- **Day 1**: Bootstrap infrastructure (vitest.config, playwright.config, Storybook setup, MSW, ErrorBoundary)
- **Day 2**: Seed coverage (3-5 component tests, stories with all states, 1 E2E smoke test)
- **Week 1**: Hardening (play() interactions, a11y checks, visual regression, 3-5 user flows)

**Quality Gates**:
- **CI Workflow**: unit → story tests → e2e (all must pass to merge)
- **Console Error Detection**: Fail CI on JavaScript console errors
- **Coverage Requirements**: 85% lines, 75% branches minimum
- **Development Rules**: Every component PR requires story + RTL test

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY GUIDELINES

### NEVER Commit These Files
- `.env` files (except .env.example, .env.template)
- Files containing local IP addresses (YOUR_SERVER_IP.x.x)
- Files with real API keys or passwords
- `config/production.env` (use production.env.template)
- `web/.env.development`, `web/.env.production`

### ALWAYS Use Placeholders in Documentation
- Passwords: `CHANGE_ME`, `YOUR_PASSWORD`, `[PASSWORD]`
- API Keys: `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`, `YOUR_*_API_KEY`
- Database URLs: Use `CHANGE_ME` for password portion
- Local IPs: Use `localhost` or `YOUR_SERVER_IP`

### Pre-commit Security Checks
The repository has active pre-commit hooks that will:
1. Block commits containing .env files
2. Detect local IP addresses
3. Scan for hardcoded credentials
4. Run Gitleaks secret detection

If blocked, fix the issue before committing!

### Production Deployment Security
- **Target Server**: root@YOUR_SERVER_IP.0.131
- **Always run**: `./scripts/setup-production-db.sh --generate-password`
- **Never commit**: Actual production passwords or API keys
- **Use templates**: Copy `production.env.template` to `production.env`
- **Rotate credentials**: If any key is exposed, rotate immediately

## 🔄 Development Workflow (2025-08-24)

### Ongoing Development Process

**Daily Development (No Changes Required):**
```bash
# Normal development workflow - continues as before
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new movie filtering feature"
git push origin main
```

**Creating Releases (New Semi-Automated Process):**
```bash
# The new cargo-release + cargo-dist workflow prevents code separation
# All operations are atomic and maintain version synchronization

# Patch release (bug fixes) - most common
cargo release patch --execute

# Minor release (new features)
cargo release minor --execute

# Major release (breaking changes)
cargo release major --execute

# Preview without executing
cargo release patch --dry-run
```

**What Happens Automatically:**
1. 🔧 **cargo-release**: Updates Cargo.toml version, creates git commit, creates tag, pushes
2. 🤖 **GitHub Actions**: Detects new tag, triggers cargo-dist release workflow
3. 🔨 **cargo-dist**: Builds cross-platform binaries with embedded web UI
4. 📦 **Release Creation**: GitHub release with installers, checksums, and documentation
5. 🌐 **User Installation**: `curl -fsSL .../radarr-mvp-installer.sh | sh`

### Code Separation Prevention Strategy
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth**: Cargo.toml version drives everything
- ✅ **Atomic Operations**: Version bump + tag + push in single operation
- ✅ **Pre-commit Validation**: Hooks prevent inconsistent states
- ✅ **Rollback Capability**: Failed releases cleanly undoable
- ✅ **GitHub Validation**: CI validates builds before release creation

## Build Management

### Build Artifact Cleanup
The Rust target directory can grow very large (50GB+) with incremental compilation artifacts. Regular cleanup is essential:

```bash
# Check current target directory size
du -sh target/

# Clean all build artifacts (recommended periodically)
cargo clean

# Build only what you need:
# For development (faster compilation, larger binary)
cargo build

# For production (slower compilation, optimized binary)
cargo build --release

# Clean and rebuild when switching between debug/release frequently
cargo clean && cargo build --release
```

### Build Best Practices
- Run `cargo clean` weekly or when target/ exceeds 10GB
- Use `cargo build --release` for deployments
- Use `cargo build` (debug) only during active development
- The debug build can be 10x larger than release
- Incremental compilation cache in target/debug/incremental can grow to 15GB+

### Database Operations
```bash
# Database migrations (requires sqlx-cli)
cargo install sqlx-cli --features postgres

# Run all migrations
sqlx migrate run

# Create new migration
sqlx migrate add description_of_migration

# Check migration status  
sqlx migrate info

# Reset database (development only)
sqlx database drop && sqlx database create && sqlx migrate run
```

### Streaming Service Commands
```bash
# Refresh Watchmode CSV mapping (manual trigger)
cargo run --bin watchmode-sync

# Test Trakt OAuth flow
cargo run --bin trakt-auth

# View cached trending data
psql -d radarr -c "SELECT cache_key, expires_at FROM streaming_cache WHERE cache_key LIKE 'trending%'"

# Clear streaming cache (force refresh)
psql -d radarr -c "DELETE FROM streaming_cache WHERE cache_key LIKE 'tmdb:%' OR cache_key LIKE 'trakt:%'"
```

### Server Deployment
```bash
# Build for deployment (from unified-radarr directory)
cd unified-radarr
cargo build --release

# Deploy to production server (ready for deployment)
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Manual deployment to target server (run from unified-radarr directory)
scp target/release/radarr-mvp root@YOUR_SERVER_IP.0.138:/opt/radarr/
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP.0.138 'systemctl restart radarr'

# Verify deployment
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP.0.138 'systemctl status radarr'
curl http://YOUR_SERVER_IP.0.138:7878/health
```

### Clean Architecture Principles

**Domain-First Design**: The `core` crate contains pure business logic with no external dependencies. All other crates depend on core, never the reverse.

**Repository Pattern**: Infrastructure crate implements repository traits defined in core for data abstraction.

**Analysis System**: Production-ready HDBits analyzers with session authentication, rate limiting, and evidence-based reputation scoring.

**Async-First**: Built on Tokio with async/await throughout. Uses `async-trait` for abstractions.

**Error Handling**: Custom `RadarrError` enum with `thiserror`. All fallible operations return `Result<T, RadarrError>`.

### Technology Stack

**Core**:
- **Language**: Rust 2021 Edition
- **Web Framework**: Axum 0.7 (high-performance async)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio (production-grade)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with SQLx 0.8 (async, compile-time checked queries)

**Key Dependencies**:
- **Parsing**: nom 7.1, regex 1.10 for release name parsing
- **HTTP Client**: reqwest 0.12 with cookies for indexer integration
- **Serialization**: serde with JSON/YAML support
- **Testing**: proptest for property-based testing, criterion for benchmarks

### Database Architecture (PostgreSQL-Only)

**Single Database Design**: Consolidated from dual EdgeDB+PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL-only for 40% performance improvement and simplified deployment.

**Advanced Features**:
- **JSONB Support**: Metadata storage with GIN indexing for graph-like queries
- **Full-Text Search**: Built-in PostgreSQL search with ranking
- **Connection Pooling**: SQLx async pool with health checks
- **Migration System**: Version-controlled schema evolution with sqlx migrate

### Critical Integration Points

**HDBits Dual Implementation Architecture**:

1. **Production Indexer** (`crates/indexers/src/hdbits/`)
   - Purpose: Real-time torrent searching for automated downloads
   - Authentication: API-based using username + passkey
   - Integration: Part of main application workflow with circuit breaker
   - Use Case: Finding and downloading releases automatically

2. **Analysis System** (`crates/analysis/src/`)
   - Purpose: Scene group reputation analysis and quality scoring
   - Authentication: Session cookie for browse.php access
   - Integration: Standalone research tools for building scoring database
   - Use Case: Analyzing release patterns to inform quality decisions
   - Output: JSON/CSV reports for quality profile configuration

**Quality Profiles**: Decision engine evaluates releases against configurable profiles with custom format support, informed by HDBits analysis data.

**Streaming Service Integration**: TMDB + Trakt + Watchmode aggregation for trending content discovery with streaming availability and deep links. PostgreSQL-cached for aggressive rate limit management.

**Server Ready**: Complete systemd service files and deployment scripts for direct server deployment.

### Development Workflow Notes

**Workspace Dependencies**: Common dependencies defined at workspace level with `workspace = true` inheritance.

**Testing Strategy**: Unit tests per crate, integration tests cross-crate, property-based tests for parsers, and end-to-end automation.

**Build Profiles**: Release uses LTO and single codegen unit for optimization. Development prioritizes compile speed.

**Environment Setup**:
```bash
# Quick start (5-minute setup)
cp .env.example .env          # Configure environment
systemctl start postgresql   # Start PostgreSQL
sqlx migrate run             # Run migrations
cargo run                    # Start server
```

# Development Workflow - Radarr MVP

**Updated**: 2025-08-24  
**Tools**: cargo-release + cargo-dist + GitHub Actions  
**Strategy**: Semi-automated semantic versioning with manual release decisions

## 🚀 Quick Reference

### Daily Development
```bash
# Normal development workflow
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new movie filtering feature"
git push origin main
```

### Creating Releases
```bash
# Patch release (bug fixes)
cargo release patch --execute

# Minor release (new features)
cargo release minor --execute

# Major release (breaking changes)
cargo release major --execute
```

### Emergency Fixes
```bash
# Quick patch for critical bugs
cargo release patch --execute
# This automatically: bumps version, creates tag, pushes, triggers GitHub release
```

## 🔄 Complete Development-to-Release Workflow

### 1. Development Phase

**Daily Development:**
```bash
# Work on features/fixes normally
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Make your changes
vim src/main.rs
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features

# Commit with conventional commit format (recommended)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add streaming provider filtering"
git push origin main
```

**Pre-Release Checks:**
```bash
# Before any release, ensure everything works
cargo test --workspace                    # All tests pass
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features # No warnings
cargo fmt --all --check                   # Formatting correct
BUILD_WEB=1 cargo build --release         # Web UI builds correctly
./target/release/radarr-mvp --help        # Binary works
```

### 2. Release Decision

**Semantic Versioning Guide:**
- **Patch (1.0.1)**: Bug fixes, security updates, documentation
- **Minor (1.1.0)**: New features, API additions (backward compatible)
- **Major (2.0.0)**: Breaking changes, API removals, architecture changes

**Examples:**
```bash
# Bug fix
cargo release patch --execute

# New API endpoint
cargo release minor --execute  

# Breaking API changes
cargo release major --execute
```

### 3. Release Execution

**cargo-release handles automatically:**
1. ✅ Version bump in `Cargo.toml`
2. ✅ Update `CHANGELOG.md` with release date
3. ✅ Create git commit with release message
4. ✅ Create git tag (e.g., `v1.0.1`)
5. ✅ Push commit and tag to GitHub
6. ✅ **cargo-dist GitHub Action triggers automatically**

**What happens after push:**
1. 🤖 GitHub Actions detects new tag
2. 🔨 cargo-dist builds cross-platform binaries
3. 🌐 Web UI assets embedded in binaries
4. 📦 Creates installers (shell script, Homebrew)
5. 📝 Generates release notes
6. 🚀 Publishes GitHub Release with all assets

### 4. Release Validation

**After release:**
```bash
# Check release was created
gh release list

# Verify assets are available
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/zimmermanc/radarr-mvp/releases/latest

# Test installer script
curl -fsSL https://github.com/zimmermanc/radarr-mvp/releases/latest/download/radarr-mvp-installer.sh

# Validate web UI works in release
# (Test on clean server or in Docker)
```

## 🛡️ Safety Mechanisms

### Pre-Release Validation
```bash
# Always run before release
cargo release patch --dry-run    # Preview changes without executing
dist plan                        # Validate cargo-dist configuration
cargo test --workspace           # Ensure tests pass
```

### Version Consistency Checks
- **cargo-release** ensures Cargo.toml and git tags stay synchronized
- **GitHub Actions** validates build before creating release
- **Pre-commit hooks** prevent invalid configurations

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# If release fails or has issues
git tag -d v1.0.1                    # Delete local tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.1    # Delete remote tag
gh release delete v1.0.1             # Delete GitHub release

# Revert version in Cargo.toml if needed
git revert HEAD                       # Revert release commit
```

## 🎯 Workflow Best Practices

### Commit Message Conventions
```bash
# Use conventional commits for clear history
feat: add new streaming provider integration
fix: resolve database connection timeout
chore: update dependencies
docs: improve installation instructions
style: fix code formatting
test: add integration tests for queue management
```

### Release Timing
- **Patch releases**: As needed for bug fixes (can be immediate)
- **Minor releases**: Weekly/bi-weekly for feature releases
- **Major releases**: Monthly/quarterly for significant changes

### Testing Requirements
- ✅ All tests pass (`cargo test --workspace`)
- ✅ No clippy warnings (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`)
- ✅ Proper formatting (`cargo fmt --all --check`)
- ✅ Web UI builds (`BUILD_WEB=1 cargo build --release`)
- ✅ Local manual testing of key features
- ✅ Database migrations work (`sqlx migrate run`)

## 🔧 Advanced Workflows

### Hotfix Releases
```bash
# For critical production issues
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Make minimal fix
git add . && git commit -m "fix: critical security vulnerability"

# Test thoroughly
cargo test && cargo clippy

# Release immediately
cargo release patch --execute
```

### Feature Releases
```bash
# For major new features
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Ensure feature is complete and tested
cargo test --workspace
BUILD_WEB=1 cargo build --release

# Document changes in CHANGELOG.md
vim CHANGELOG.md

# Release
cargo release minor --execute
```

### Pre-release Testing
```bash
# Create pre-release for testing
cargo release minor --no-push --tag-name="v{{version}}-beta"

# After validation, create final release
cargo release minor --execute
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Working directory is not clean":**
```bash
git status              # Check what's uncommitted
git add . && git commit # Commit or stash changes
```

**"Tag already exists":**
```bash
git tag -d v1.0.1                    # Delete local tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.1    # Delete remote tag
```

**"GitHub Actions failing":**
```bash
gh run list --limit 5    # Check recent runs
gh run view --log        # Check failure details
```

**"cargo-dist build failing":**
```bash
dist plan               # Test cargo-dist locally
BUILD_WEB=1 cargo build --release  # Test web UI build
```

### Recovery Procedures

**Failed Release Recovery:**
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
2. Fix issues in code
3. Delete failed tag: `git tag -d v1.0.1 && git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.1`
4. Delete GitHub release if created: `gh release delete v1.0.1`
5. Re-run release: `cargo release patch --execute`

## 📊 Monitoring and Validation

### Release Health Checks
```bash
# After each release, verify:
gh release list                                           # Release created
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/zimmermanc/radarr-mvp/releases/latest | jq .tag_name  # Latest version
gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 1             # Build successful

# Test installation works
curl -fsSL https://github.com/zimmermanc/radarr-mvp/releases/latest/download/radarr-mvp-installer.sh | head -20
```

### Continuous Integration Status
```bash
# Check all CI workflows
gh run list --limit 5
gh workflow list

# Monitor specific workflows
gh run watch  # Watch current runs
```

## 🎯 Next Release Preparation

To prepare for your next release:

1. **Make your changes** and commit normally to main
2. **Run pre-release checks** (tests, clippy, formatting)
3. **Choose version bump** based on changes made
4. **Execute release**: `cargo release [patch|minor|major] --execute`
5. **Validate GitHub release** created successfully
6. **Test installation** on clean system

The workflow ensures **code never becomes separated** because:
- ✅ All releases are created from main branch
- ✅ Version numbers automatically synchronized
- ✅ cargo-release handles all git operations atomically
- ✅ Failed releases can be cleanly rolled back
- ✅ GitHub Actions validate builds before releasing

**No manual tag creation needed** - cargo-release handles everything!
