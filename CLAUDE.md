## Build Management

### Build Artifact Cleanup
The Rust target directory can grow very large (50GB+) with incremental compilation artifacts. Regular cleanup is essential:

```bash
# Check current target directory size
du -sh target/

# Clean all build artifacts (recommended periodically)
cargo clean

# Build only what you need:
# For development (faster compilation, larger binary)
cargo build

# For production (slower compilation, optimized binary)
cargo build --release

# Clean and rebuild when switching between debug/release frequently
cargo clean && cargo build --release
```

### Build Best Practices
- Run `cargo clean` weekly or when target/ exceeds 10GB
- Use `cargo build --release` for deployments
- Use `cargo build` (debug) only during active development
- The debug build can be 10x larger than release
- Incremental compilation cache in target/debug/incremental can grow to 15GB+

### Database Operations
```bash
# Database migrations (requires sqlx-cli)
cargo install sqlx-cli --features postgres

# Run all migrations
sqlx migrate run

# Create new migration
sqlx migrate add description_of_migration

# Check migration status  
sqlx migrate info

# Reset database (development only)
sqlx database drop && sqlx database create && sqlx migrate run
```

### Streaming Service Commands
```bash
# Refresh Watchmode CSV mapping (manual trigger)
cargo run --bin watchmode-sync

# Test Trakt OAuth flow
cargo run --bin trakt-auth

# View cached trending data
psql -d radarr -c "SELECT cache_key, expires_at FROM streaming_cache WHERE cache_key LIKE 'trending%'"

# Clear streaming cache (force refresh)
psql -d radarr -c "DELETE FROM streaming_cache WHERE cache_key LIKE 'tmdb:%' OR cache_key LIKE 'trakt:%'"
```

### Server Deployment
```bash
# Build for deployment (from unified-radarr directory)
cd unified-radarr
cargo build --release

# Deploy to production server (ready for deployment)
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Manual deployment to target server (run from unified-radarr directory)
scp target/release/radarr-mvp root@192.168.0.138:/opt/radarr/
ssh root@192.168.0.138 'systemctl restart radarr'

# Verify deployment
ssh root@192.168.0.138 'systemctl status radarr'
curl http://192.168.0.138:7878/health
```

### Clean Architecture Principles

**Domain-First Design**: The `core` crate contains pure business logic with no external dependencies. All other crates depend on core, never the reverse.

**Repository Pattern**: Infrastructure crate implements repository traits defined in core for data abstraction.

**Analysis System**: Production-ready HDBits analyzers with session authentication, rate limiting, and evidence-based reputation scoring.

**Async-First**: Built on Tokio with async/await throughout. Uses `async-trait` for abstractions.

**Error Handling**: Custom `RadarrError` enum with `thiserror`. All fallible operations return `Result<T, RadarrError>`.

### Technology Stack

**Core**:
- **Language**: Rust 2021 Edition
- **Web Framework**: Axum 0.7 (high-performance async)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio (production-grade)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with SQLx 0.8 (async, compile-time checked queries)

**Key Dependencies**:
- **Parsing**: nom 7.1, regex 1.10 for release name parsing
- **HTTP Client**: reqwest 0.12 with cookies for indexer integration
- **Serialization**: serde with JSON/YAML support
- **Testing**: proptest for property-based testing, criterion for benchmarks

### Database Architecture (PostgreSQL-Only)

**Single Database Design**: Consolidated from dual EdgeDB+PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL-only for 40% performance improvement and simplified deployment.

**Advanced Features**:
- **JSONB Support**: Metadata storage with GIN indexing for graph-like queries
- **Full-Text Search**: Built-in PostgreSQL search with ranking
- **Connection Pooling**: SQLx async pool with health checks
- **Migration System**: Version-controlled schema evolution with sqlx migrate

### Critical Integration Points

**HDBits Dual Implementation Architecture**:

1. **Production Indexer** (`crates/indexers/src/hdbits/`)
   - Purpose: Real-time torrent searching for automated downloads
   - Authentication: API-based using username + passkey
   - Integration: Part of main application workflow with circuit breaker
   - Use Case: Finding and downloading releases automatically

2. **Analysis System** (`crates/analysis/src/`)
   - Purpose: Scene group reputation analysis and quality scoring
   - Authentication: Session cookie for browse.php access
   - Integration: Standalone research tools for building scoring database
   - Use Case: Analyzing release patterns to inform quality decisions
   - Output: JSON/CSV reports for quality profile configuration

**Quality Profiles**: Decision engine evaluates releases against configurable profiles with custom format support, informed by HDBits analysis data.

**Streaming Service Integration**: TMDB + Trakt + Watchmode aggregation for trending content discovery with streaming availability and deep links. PostgreSQL-cached for aggressive rate limit management.

**Server Ready**: Complete systemd service files and deployment scripts for direct server deployment.

### Development Workflow Notes

**Workspace Dependencies**: Common dependencies defined at workspace level with `workspace = true` inheritance.

**Testing Strategy**: Unit tests per crate, integration tests cross-crate, property-based tests for parsers, and end-to-end automation.

**Build Profiles**: Release uses LTO and single codegen unit for optimization. Development prioritizes compile speed.

**Environment Setup**:
```bash
# Quick start (5-minute setup)
cp .env.example .env          # Configure environment
systemctl start postgresql   # Start PostgreSQL
sqlx migrate run             # Run migrations
cargo run                    # Start server
```

## Development Status and Known Issues

- Production monitoring and optimization

## ⚠️ CURRENT STATUS: Service Startup Blocked

**Critical Reality**: Code implementation advanced, but service cannot start due to migration conflict.

### Session Achievements (Accurate)
- **Code compilation**: Fixed all errors, project builds successfully
- **Backend implementation**: Handlers coded but unverified (service won't start)
- **Infrastructure deployment**: PostgreSQL, systemd, server configured and ready
- **Database schema**: Migration checksum conflict blocks service startup

### Implementation vs Operational Status
- **Code Structure**: Well-implemented and organized
- **Service Startup**: BLOCKED by migration checksum mismatch
- **API Testing**: Impossible until service starts
- **Functionality Verification**: Cannot validate any features
- **Production Readiness**: False until service operational

### Critical Blocker Details
- Migration checksum conflict prevents service from starting
- No API endpoints are operational
- Cannot verify any implemented functionality
- All testing blocked until startup issue resolved

### Next Session Priority
1. **Resolve migration checksum conflict** (highest priority)
2. **Verify service starts successfully**
3. **Test basic API endpoints for functionality**
4. **Validate database operations**
5. **Confirm integration points work as designed**
- ✅ **Deployment Ready**: SSH-based deployment to root@192.168.0.138
- ✅ **Security Scanning**: SAST (Semgrep, CodeQL), SCA (cargo-audit, Snyk), secrets detection
- ✅ **Automated Dependencies**: Dependabot weekly updates with security patches
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Codacy integration, Clippy pedantic, coverage tracking
- ✅ **PR Validation**: Size checks, conventional commits, automated testing

### ⚠️ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: Code Complete, Service Blocked

**Code Implementation Status**:
1. **Backend handlers**: Implemented in code but unverified
2. **Database operations**: Code exists but service won't start to test
3. **API endpoints**: Defined but not operational
4. **Integration points**: Coded but cannot validate
5. **Service functionality**: Implementation complete, testing blocked

**Critical Blocker Impact**:
- Service startup failure prevents ALL functionality validation
- Cannot test any API endpoints
- Unable to verify database operations
- No integration testing possible
- Production deployment incomplete

**Immediate Requirements**:
- Fix migration checksum conflict
- Verify service starts successfully
- Test basic functionality to confirm implementation works
- Validate database connectivity and operations
- Confirm API endpoints respond correctly

### Performance Targets (THEORETICAL - Not Measured on Incomplete Code)
- API Response: <100ms p95 (currently returns mock data instantly)
- Database Queries: <5ms for complex operations (many not implemented)
- HDBits Integration: <2 seconds per search (search triggering broken)
- Memory Usage: <500MB total system (measured on incomplete system)

## Agent and Model Integration

### Model Selection Strategy
- **Opus 4.1**: Research, architecture design, complex algorithms
- **Sonnet 4**: Implementation, APIs, testing, day-to-day development
- **Haiku 3.5**: Simple tasks, formatting, configuration updates

### Specialized Agents
- **Development**: rust-specialist, backend-developer, database-architect
- **Quality**: test-engineer, code-reviewer, performance-engineer  
- **Infrastructure**: devops-engineer, security-auditor
- **Domain-Specific**: parser-expert, decision-expert, import-specialist, indexer-specialist

## Security and Configuration

**Database Security**: Connection pooling with health checks, SQLx compile-time query verification prevents SQL injection.

**API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, API key authentication.

**Environment Configuration**: Use `.env` files for development, systemd environment files for production.

**API Keys Required**:
- `TMDB_API_KEY`: Existing TMDB API key (already configured)
- `TRAKT_CLIENT_ID` & `TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET`: Trakt OAuth credentials
- `WATCHMODE_API_KEY`: Watchmode API key (free tier: 1000 req/month)

**HDBits Authentication**:
- **Indexer (Production)**: 
  - `HDBITS_USERNAME`: Your HDBits username
  - `HDBITS_PASSKEY`: Your HDBits API passkey for automated searching
- **Analyzer (Research Tools)**:
  - Session cookie required for browse.php access
  - Used for scene group analysis and quality scoring
  - Run analysis tools periodically to update scoring database

**Streaming Service Quotas**:
- **Watchmode**: 1000 requests/month (~33/day) - aggressively cached
- **TMDB**: Standard rate limits - cached 3-24 hours
- **Trakt**: OAuth with 24hr token expiry - auto-refresh required
