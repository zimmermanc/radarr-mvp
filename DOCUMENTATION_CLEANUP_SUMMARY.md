## üìà Documentation Accuracy Metrics

### Before Cleanup
- **Accuracy**: Mixed (outdated claims vs reality)
- **Consistency**: Poor (conflicting information across files)
- **Completeness**: Partial (missing current state documentation)
- **Usefulness**: Limited (couldn't resume work easily)

### After Cleanup
- **Accuracy**: ‚úÖ High (evidence-based current state)
- **Consistency**: ‚úÖ Excellent (all files align with ~75% completion)
- **Completeness**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive (detailed status and resume guidance)
- **Usefulness**: ‚úÖ Excellent (can immediately resume development)

## üîß Technical Implementation Evidence

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Build verification
cd /home/thetu/radarr-mvp/unified-radarr
cargo build --workspace --release

# Test functionality
cargo test --workspace -- --test-threads=1

# Server health check
cargo run &
sleep 5
curl http://localhost:7878/health
pkill unified-radarr
```

### Working Integrations Verified
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database operations
- ‚úÖ TMDB API integration
- ‚úÖ HDBits scraper functionality
- ‚úÖ qBittorrent client operations
