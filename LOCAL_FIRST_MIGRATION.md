# Local-First Development Migration

This document summarizes the changes made to migrate from a container orchestration approach to a local-first development workflow with direct server deployment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Updates

#### README.md
- ✅ Removed Docker and Kubernetes references
- ✅ Updated deployment section to focus on SSH-based deployment
- ✅ Changed "Cloud Ready" to "Local-First" in features
- ✅ Updated prerequisites to remove Docker requirement
- ✅ Updated setup instructions to use local PostgreSQL

#### CLAUDE.md (both root and unified-radarr)
- ✅ Replaced Kubernetes deployment commands with server deployment
- ✅ Updated architecture diagrams to remove k8s references
- ✅ Added SSH-based deployment instructions
- ✅ Updated configuration paths from k8s/ to systemd/

#### DEPLOYMENT.md (NEW)
- ✅ Created comprehensive server deployment guide
- ✅ Includes one-time server setup instructions
- ✅ Covers PostgreSQL installation and configuration
- ✅ Provides systemd service configuration
- ✅ Includes troubleshooting and monitoring sections

### 2. Environment Configuration

#### .env.example
- ✅ Added comments distinguishing local vs server paths
- ✅ Updated database URL comments for server deployment
- ✅ Added media and download path examples

#### .env.server.example (NEW)
- ✅ Created server-specific configuration template
- ✅ Pre-configured for 192.168.0.138 deployment
- ✅ Includes server-specific paths and settings

### 3. Deployment Automation

#### scripts/deploy.sh (NEW)
- ✅ Created automated SSH-based deployment script
- ✅ Includes build, copy, service management
- ✅ Provides health checks and status verification
- ✅ Colored output for better user experience

#### scripts/archive-k8s.sh (NEW)
- ✅ Script to archive Kubernetes manifests
- ✅ Preserves k8s files in k8s.archived/ directory

### 4. Service Management

#### systemd/radarr.service (NEW)
- ✅ Created systemd service file for server deployment
- ✅ Includes security settings and resource limits
- ✅ Configured for proper dependency management

### 5. Container Orchestration Cleanup

#### Kubernetes Manifests
- ✅ Moved k8s/ directory to k8s.archived/
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to exclude archived k8s directory
- ✅ Removed all references to Kubernetes in active documentation

## New Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
cd unified-radarr
cp .env.example .env
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sqlx migrate run
cargo run
```

### Server Deployment
```bash
cd unified-radarr
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Server Management
```bash
# Check status
ssh root@192.168.0.138 'systemctl status radarr'

# View logs
ssh root@192.168.0.138 'journalctl -u radarr -f'

# Restart service
ssh root@192.168.0.138 'systemctl restart radarr'
```

## Benefits of Local-First Approach

### Simplified Development
- ✅ No container orchestration complexity
- ✅ Direct local PostgreSQL usage
- ✅ Faster development iteration
- ✅ Simplified debugging and troubleshooting

### Streamlined Deployment
- ✅ Single command deployment (`./scripts/deploy.sh`)
- ✅ SSH-based automation
- ✅ Standard systemd service management
- ✅ Direct server access for troubleshooting

### Reduced Dependencies
- ✅ Eliminated Docker/Kubernetes requirements
- ✅ Standard Linux service management
- ✅ Local PostgreSQL installation
- ✅ Simplified backup and recovery

## Migration Status

- ✅ **Documentation**: All files updated to reflect local-first approach
- ✅ **Deployment Scripts**: Automated SSH-based deployment created
- ✅ **Service Configuration**: Systemd service files ready
- ✅ **Environment Setup**: Local and server configurations prepared
- ✅ **Container Cleanup**: Kubernetes manifests archived
- ✅ **Workflow Documentation**: Complete deployment guide created

## Next Steps

1. **Test Deployment**: Run `./scripts/deploy.sh` to test server deployment
2. **Server Setup**: Follow DEPLOYMENT.md for initial server configuration
3. **Environment Configuration**: Update .env.production with actual credentials
4. **Database Migration**: Run migrations against production database
5. **Service Verification**: Ensure systemd service starts correctly

## Preserved for Reference

- Kubernetes manifests preserved in `k8s.archived/`
- Original deployment approach documented for future reference
- Container orchestration can be re-enabled if needed

This migration successfully transforms the project from a container-first to a local-first development approach while maintaining all functionality and improving deployment simplicity.
