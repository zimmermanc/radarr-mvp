# REALITY ASSESSMENT: Radarr MVP Actual State

**Date**: 2025-01-24  
**Actual Completion**: ~55%  
**TODO Count**: 41  
**False Claims Corrected**: 5 major features  

## Executive Summary

This project's documentation was systematically overstating completion by approximately 30%. The codebase contains 41 TODO comments directly contradicting major feature completion claims. This assessment provides the actual state without embellishment.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

### Claimed vs Reality
- **Claimed**: 85% complete, production-ready
- **Actual**: 55% complete, significant gaps in core functionality
- **Delta**: -30% (documentation inflation factor)

### TODO Distribution
- **11 TODOs**: List management and TMDb integration
- **10 TODOs**: Web UI queue operations
- **6 TODOs**: API endpoints returning mock data
- **6 TODOs**: RSS service and search triggering
- **5 TODOs**: Quality management and metadata
- **3 TODOs**: Event publishing architecture

## Critical Architectural Breaks

### 1. RSS → Search Pipeline: BROKEN
```rust
// src/services/rss_service.rs:500
// TODO: Implement actual movie search
// This is the CORE AUTOMATION - it doesn't work
```
The RSS monitor logs that it wants to search but the search method is empty. This isn't a minor gap - it's the primary automated workflow.

### 2. Event Bus: HALF IMPLEMENTED
```rust
// src/services/workflow.rs:480
// TODO: Publish ImportComplete event
// TODO: Publish ImportFailed event
```
Your "event-driven architecture" doesn't publish half its events. That's not architecture - it's aspiration.

### 3. TMDb Lists: COMPLETE FACADE
```rust
// All 8 methods in tmdb.rs
pub async fn get_list(&self, list_id: &str) -> Result<Vec<ListItem>, ListParseError> {
    info!("Fetching TMDb list {}", list_id);
    // TODO: Implement using existing TMDb client
    Ok(vec![])  // Returns empty vector, claims success
}
```
Every TMDb list method is a lie wrapped in a log statement.

## What Actually Works

### Solid Foundations (70-80% complete)
- **Database Schema**: Properly designed, migrations work
- **Basic API Structure**: Routes exist, middleware configured
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions properly configured
- **HDBits Indexer**: Basic search functionality works

### Partial Implementations (40-60% complete)
- **Import Pipeline**: Structure exists, missing movie info retrieval
- **Queue System**: Basic queue works, UI operations mocked
- **Event System**: Infrastructure exists, critical events not published
- **RSS Monitor**: Calendar works, can't trigger actions

### Facades and Stubs (0-20% complete)
- **TMDb List Operations**: Complete stubs
- **List Sync Monitoring**: Exists but disconnected
- **Web UI Queue Actions**: All mocked
- **Quality Metadata Extraction**: Mostly TODOs

## The Three Paths Forward

### Path 1: Complete the Implementation (6-8 weeks)
**Effort**: High  
**Risk**: Low  
**Outcome**: Actual 85% completion  

Implement the 41 TODOs systematically:
1. Week 1-2: Fix core pipeline (RSS→Search→Download)
2. Week 3-4: Complete event architecture
3. Week 5-6: Implement TMDb lists and monitoring
4. Week 7-8: Wire up UI and polish

### Path 2: Reduce Scope to Match Reality (1-2 weeks)
**Effort**: Low  
**Risk**: Medium  
**Outcome**: Honest MVP at current capability  

Cut these features entirely:
- TMDb list integration (not critical for MVP)
- Advanced monitoring dashboards
- Web UI queue management
- Custom format metadata extraction

Ship what works: Basic search, download, import with HDBits.

### Path 3: Pivot to Honesty-First Development (Immediate)
**Effort**: Minimal  
**Risk**: None  
**Outcome**: Accurate project state  

1. Mark all incomplete features as "EXPERIMENTAL"
2. Add startup warnings about incomplete functionality
3. Convert TODOs to GitHub issues
4. Update README with "Known Limitations" section
5. Stop claiming features work when they don't

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Choose a path** - Don't continue pretending
2. **Update all documentation** - Remove false claims
3. **Implement Priority 1 TODOs** - Core functionality only
4. **Add integration tests** - For what actually works

### Technical Debt Priority
1. **RSS Search** (3 TODOs) - Core automation broken
2. **Event Publishing** (3 TODOs) - Architecture incomplete  
3. **Database Queries** (1 TODO) - API returning fake data
4. **Monitor Wiring** (3 TODOs) - Monitoring disconnected

### Documentation Hygiene
- Replace "✅ Complete" with "⚠️ Partial (X TODOs)"
- Add "Known Issues" section to README
- Create LIMITATIONS.md listing what doesn't work
- Update TASKLIST.md with realistic timelines

## Conclusion

This project has solid foundations but significant gaps in claimed functionality. The ~55% complete assessment reflects actual working code, not aspirational documentation. 

The choice is simple:
1. **Build it** - Implement the missing 30%
2. **Cut it** - Reduce scope to match reality
3. **Admit it** - Document actual limitations

Continuing to claim 85% completion with 41 TODOs is delusional.

## Metrics for Success

Track these honestly:
- **TODO Burndown**: 41 → 0
- **Test Coverage**: Currently testing stubs
- **Integration Points**: 5 major disconnects
- **Mock Data Endpoints**: 6+ returning fake data
- **Event Publishing**: 0/2 critical events

When these metrics improve, update documentation accordingly. Not before.
