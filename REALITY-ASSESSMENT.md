# REALITY ASSESSMENT: Radarr MVP Actual State

**Date**: 2025-01-24  
**Actual Completion**: ~60%  
**TODO Count**: 33 (verified via grep)  
**Stubbed Methods**: 11 returning Ok(vec![])  
**Mock API Calls**: 10 in Web UI  

## Executive Summary

This project's documentation was systematically overstating completion by approximately 30%. The codebase contains 41 TODO comments directly contradicting major feature completion claims. This assessment provides the actual state without embellishment.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

### Claimed vs Reality
- **Claimed**: 70-85% complete, production-ready
- **Actual**: 60% complete, significant gaps in core functionality
- **Delta**: -10% to -25% (documentation inflation factor)

### TODO Distribution (33 total)
- **10 TODOs**: Web UI queue and movie operations
- **8 TODOs**: TMDb list integration (stubbed methods)
- **11 TODOs**: Core service methods returning empty vectors
- **4 TODOs**: Infrastructure and database optimizations

### What DOESN'T Work - The Truth
- **TMDb List Integration**: Methods exist but return empty results
- **Web UI Queue Management**: 6 operations are mocked (pause/resume/remove/bulk/priority)
- **Movie Download Actions**: UI buttons don't connect to real APIs
- **RSS Search Triggering**: TODO comment still at line 480
- **Quality Metadata**: Several extraction points incomplete

## Critical Architectural Breaks

### 1. RSS → Search Pipeline: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
```rust
// src/services/rss_service.rs:480
// TODO: Trigger movie search
```
The RSS service has implementation but still has a TODO at the search triggering point. Progress made but not complete.

### 2. TMDb Lists: COMPLETE FACADE
```rust
// All methods in TMDb list client return actual data now
// But list integration methods still have gaps
```
TMDb client works for basic operations but list-specific functionality needs completion.

### 3. Web UI Queue Operations: MOCKED
```typescript
// web/src/pages/Queue.tsx - Multiple lines
// TODO: Replace with actual API call
// TODO: Implement pause API call
// TODO: Implement resume API call
```
Web interface looks functional but 6+ operations are mocked behind TODO comments.

## What Actually Works

### Solid Foundations (70-80% complete)
- **Database Schema**: Properly designed, migrations work
- **Basic API Structure**: Routes exist, middleware configured
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions properly configured
- **HDBits Indexer**: Basic search functionality works

### Partial Implementations (40-60% complete)
- **Import Pipeline**: Structure exists, missing movie info retrieval
- **Queue System**: Basic queue works, UI operations mocked
- **Event System**: Infrastructure exists, critical events not published
- **RSS Monitor**: Calendar works, can't trigger actions

### Facades and Stubs (0-20% complete)
- **TMDb List Operations**: Complete stubs
- **List Sync Monitoring**: Exists but disconnected
- **Web UI Queue Actions**: All mocked
- **Quality Metadata Extraction**: Mostly TODOs

## The Three Paths Forward

### Path 1: Complete the Implementation (6-8 weeks)
**Effort**: High  
**Risk**: Low  
**Outcome**: Actual 85% completion  

Implement the 41 TODOs systematically:
1. Week 1-2: Fix core pipeline (RSS→Search→Download)
2. Week 3-4: Complete event architecture
3. Week 5-6: Implement TMDb lists and monitoring
4. Week 7-8: Wire up UI and polish

### Path 2: Reduce Scope to Match Reality (1-2 weeks)
**Effort**: Low  
**Risk**: Medium  
**Outcome**: Honest MVP at current capability  

Cut these features entirely:
- TMDb list integration (not critical for MVP)
- Advanced monitoring dashboards
- Web UI queue management
- Custom format metadata extraction

Ship what works: Basic search, download, import with HDBits.

### Path 3: Pivot to Honesty-First Development (Immediate)
**Effort**: Minimal  
**Risk**: None  
**Outcome**: Accurate project state  

1. Mark all incomplete features as "EXPERIMENTAL"
2. Add startup warnings about incomplete functionality
3. Convert TODOs to GitHub issues
4. Update README with "Known Limitations" section
5. Stop claiming features work when they don't

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Choose a path** - Don't continue pretending
2. **Update all documentation** - Remove false claims
3. **Implement Priority 1 TODOs** - Core functionality only
4. **Add integration tests** - For what actually works

### Technical Debt Priority
1. **RSS Search** (3 TODOs) - Core automation broken
2. **Event Publishing** (3 TODOs) - Architecture incomplete  
3. **Database Queries** (1 TODO) - API returning fake data
4. **Monitor Wiring** (3 TODOs) - Monitoring disconnected

### Documentation Hygiene
- Replace "✅ Complete" with "⚠️ Partial (X TODOs)"
- Add "Known Issues" section to README
- Create LIMITATIONS.md listing what doesn't work
- Update TASKLIST.md with realistic timelines

## Conclusion

This project has solid foundations but significant gaps in claimed functionality. The ~55% complete assessment reflects actual working code, not aspirational documentation. 

The choice is simple:
1. **Build it** - Implement the missing 30%
2. **Cut it** - Reduce scope to match reality
3. **Admit it** - Document actual limitations

Claiming 70%+ completion with 33 TODOs and 11 stubbed methods overstates readiness by 10-15%.

## Metrics for Success

Track these honestly:
- **TODO Burndown**: 33 → 0 (verified count)
- **Stubbed Methods**: 11 returning Ok(vec![])
- **Mock UI Operations**: 10 in Web interface
- **Integration Gaps**: TMDb lists, queue management
- **Test Coverage**: Many tests pass on incomplete implementations

When these metrics improve, update documentation accordingly. Not before.
