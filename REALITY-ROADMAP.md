# REALITY ROADMAP - Evidence-Based Path to Production

**Created**: 2025-08-21  
**Current State**: 15-30% Complete (Proof of Concept)  
**Target**: Production-Ready System  
**Realistic Timeline**: 6-8 weeks

## Current Truth (No Sugar-Coating)

### What Actually Works
- ✅ Individual components compile
- ✅ PostgreSQL database schema exists
- ✅ TMDB API integration functions
- ✅ Basic architectural structure is sound

### What's Completely Broken
- ❌ **QueueProcessor exists but never starts** (main.rs:54-124)
- ❌ **No event system** - components can't communicate
- ❌ **Integration tests won't compile** (18 errors)
- ❌ **20+ TODO comments** in critical paths
- ❌ **Download→Import flow disconnected** (integration.rs:123)

## Critical Path to Functional System

### Week 1: Foundation Fixes (MUST DO FIRST)
**Goal**: Get basic infrastructure running

#### Day 1-2: Start the Queue Processor
```rust
// In main.rs, actually start the queue processor!
let queue_processor = QueueProcessor::new(app_state.clone());
tokio::spawn(async move {
    queue_processor.start().await;
});
```
**Verification**: `curl localhost:7878/api/queue/status` returns active

#### Day 3-4: Implement Basic Event Bus
```rust
// Simple tokio broadcast channel for events
pub struct EventBus {
    sender: broadcast::Sender<SystemEvent>,
}
```
**Verification**: Components log received events

#### Day 5: Fix Integration Test Compilation
- Resolve 18 compilation errors in tests/integration.rs
- Get at least one end-to-end test passing
**Verification**: `cargo test integration` compiles and runs

### Week 2: Connect the Pipeline
**Goal**: One complete workflow actually functions

#### Day 1-2: Wire Download Completion → Import
- Remove TODO at integration.rs:123
- Implement actual pipeline result collection
**Verification**: Download completion triggers import

#### Day 3-4: Implement Retry Logic
- Add exponential backoff for failed operations
- Create dead letter queue for permanent failures
**Verification**: Failed downloads retry 3 times

#### Day 5: Add Progress Tracking
- Implement progress updates via event bus
- Store progress in database
**Verification**: UI shows real-time progress

### Week 3: Integration & Testing
**Goal**: System works end-to-end

#### Day 1-2: Complete API Endpoints
- Replace all stub implementations
- Remove TODOs from handlers
**Verification**: All API endpoints return real data

#### Day 3-4: Cross-Filesystem Support
- Fix hardlink manager for Docker volumes
- Add fallback to copy when hardlink fails
**Verification**: Import works across mount points

#### Day 5: Integration Test Suite
- Write tests for complete workflows
- Add CI/CD pipeline
**Verification**: 10+ integration tests passing

### Week 4: Error Handling & Recovery
**Goal**: System handles failures gracefully

#### Day 1-2: Circuit Breakers
- Add circuit breakers for external services
- Implement health checks
**Verification**: System stays up when indexer fails

#### Day 3-4: Duplicate Detection
- Implement duplicate movie detection
- Add quality upgrade logic
**Verification**: No duplicate imports

#### Day 5: Error Recovery
- Implement graceful degradation
- Add manual retry endpoints
**Verification**: System recovers from failures

### Week 5-6: Production Hardening
**Goal**: System ready for real users

#### Items to Complete:
- Performance testing under load
- Security audit and fixes
- Docker deployment validation
- Kubernetes testing
- Documentation updates
- Monitoring integration

## Definition of Done (Per Feature)

A feature is NOT complete until:
1. ✅ Background job processes it
2. ✅ Events notify other components
3. ✅ Errors are handled with retries
4. ✅ Progress is trackable
5. ✅ Integration tests pass
6. ✅ Performance is measured
7. ✅ Production scenario tested

**Current features meeting this criteria: 0**

## Honest Completion Tracking

| Milestone | Current | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 6 |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Core Infrastructure | 5% | 60% | 80% | 90% | 95% | 100% |
| Component Integration | 10% | 30% | 60% | 80% | 90% | 100% |
| Error Handling | 0% | 10% | 30% | 50% | 80% | 100% |
| Testing Coverage | 15% | 30% | 50% | 70% | 85% | 95% |
| Production Ready | 15% | 25% | 40% | 60% | 75% | 95% |

## Success Metrics (Measurable)

### Week 1 Success
- [ ] QueueProcessor running (check logs)
- [ ] Events flowing between components (check logs)
- [ ] 1+ integration test passing

### Week 2 Success
- [ ] Download→Import workflow completes
- [ ] Retry logic triggers on failure
- [ ] Progress updates in database

### Week 3 Success
- [ ] 10+ integration tests passing
- [ ] All API endpoints return real data
- [ ] Docker deployment works

### Week 4 Success
- [ ] System survives indexer outage
- [ ] No duplicate imports in testing
- [ ] Manual recovery works

### Week 6 Success
- [ ] 50+ concurrent users supported
- [ ] <100ms API response time
- [ ] 24 hour uptime test passed

## Risk Register

### High Risk Items
1. **QueueProcessor integration** - Never tested, may have hidden issues
2. **Event system design** - No existing implementation to build on
3. **Cross-filesystem moves** - Docker/K8s complexity
4. **Performance under load** - Unknown bottlenecks

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simplest implementation
- Add monitoring early
- Test in Docker from day 1
- Profile performance weekly

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **STOP** claiming features are complete
2. **START** the QueueProcessor in main.rs
3. **FIX** integration test compilation
4. **IMPLEMENT** basic event bus
5. **TEST** one complete workflow

## The Hard Truth

This project has good bones but needs 6-8 weeks of focused work to be production-ready. The "100% complete" claims were aspirational, not factual. 

**Current State**: Proof of concept with solid architecture  
**Required Effort**: 6-8 weeks of full-time development  
**Success Probability**: High IF we follow this roadmap

No more false victories. Only evidence-based progress.
