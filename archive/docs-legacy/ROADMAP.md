# Radarr MVP Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Current Completion**: ~85% (Quality Engine complete, Lists phase active)  
**Target**: Production-ready torrent automation system  
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks to full production

## üéØ Project Vision

A modern, high-performance movie automation system focused on **torrent-only** functionality (no Usenet) with qBittorrent as the download client. Built with Rust for the backend and React for the frontend, emphasizing reliability, observability, and clean architecture.

## üìä Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ What's Working (Verified)
- **Architecture**: Clean multi-crate Rust workspace with proper separation
- **Core Components**: Domain models, repositories, and services implemented
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with migrations and connection pooling
- **API Server**: 35+ endpoints running on port 7878
- **Web UI**: React frontend with authentication
- **Event System**: Tokio broadcast channels for component communication
- **Background Jobs**: Queue processor implemented with retry logic
- **Circuit Breakers**: Fault tolerance for external services
- **Quality Engine**: Complete scoring system with custom formats
- **HDBits Integration**: Production-ready with deduplication and rate limiting
- **Test Infrastructure**: 35/35 tests passing across all components
- **Production Deployment**: Live on test server (192.168.0.138)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Work
- **Lists Integration**: OAuth flows and external API management
- **Prowlarr Integration**: Multi-indexer support deferred

- **Import Pipeline**: Production-ready but needs monitoring improvements
- **Notifications**: Not implemented
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI spec in progress

### ‚ùå What's Missing
- **Prowlarr Integration**: Multi-indexer support
- **Lists & Discovery**: Trakt/IMDb/TMDb importers
- **Blocklist System**: Failure tracking and retry management
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI spec and Swagger UI

- **Download Client**: qBittorrent only
- **Indexers**: HDBits + Prowlarr (torrent-only)

### Architectural Principles

3. **Performance Under Load**: Untested at scale
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Filesystem and permission issues

### Mitigation Strategies
- Fix tests first before any new features
- Mock external services for testing
- Load test early and often
- Test on dedicated server (192.168.0.138) from day one

1. Implement Trakt device OAuth flow
2. Create IMDb list parsing and import
