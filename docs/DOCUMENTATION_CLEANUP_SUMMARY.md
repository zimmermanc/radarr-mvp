# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Action**: Consolidated conflicting documentation and created accurate project status

## 📁 Files Archived

The following files were moved to `/docs/archive/old-status-docs/` due to conflicting or outdated information:

1. **CURRENT_STATUS.md** - Claimed 75% completion (overly optimistic)
2. **PROGRESS.md** - Had conflicting sections (one claiming production ready, another showing critical gaps)
3. **REALITY-ROADMAP.md** - Claimed 82% completion and production deployment (not verified)
4. **DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md** - Outdated documentation tracking
5. **WEEK1_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md** - Old weekly report

## 📄 New Documentation Created

### Primary Documents

1. **[ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md)**
   - Realistic 8-10 week timeline to production
   - Clear milestones (M0-M7) aligned with roadmap_scoped.md
   - Evidence-based completion percentages
   - Focus on torrent-only functionality

2. **[TASKLIST.md](../../TASKLIST.md)**
   - Actionable tasks for current sprint
   - Day-by-day breakdown for Week 1
   - Specific code locations and commands
   - Verification criteria for each task

3. **[PROJECT_STATUS.md](../../PROJECT_STATUS.md)**
   - Accurate 60% completion assessment
   - Component-by-component status matrix
   - Clear indication of what works vs what doesn't
   - Risk assessment and blockers

4. **[README.md](../../README.md)** (Updated)
   - Removed inflated completion claims
   - Added accurate status badges
   - Clear development focus
   - Honest disclaimer about production readiness

## 🎯 Key Changes

### Before (Conflicting Claims)
- Multiple documents claiming 75-82% completion
- Claims of production deployment at 192.168.0.138
- Assertions that core features were "operational"
- Week 3 marked as "COMPLETE"

### After (Reality-Based)
- Consistent 60% completion across all documents
- Clear indication of development status
- Honest assessment of testing problems
- Focus on fixing foundations first

## 📊 Accuracy Improvements

| Metric | Old Claims | Reality | Difference |
|--------|------------|---------|------------|
| Overall Completion | 75-82% | 60% | -20% |
| Production Ready | "Deployed" | Not Ready | -100% |
| Tests Working | "98% passing" | Won't compile | -98% |
| Integration Complete | "Fully operational" | 70% wired | -30% |

## 🔍 Documentation Principles Applied

1. **Evidence-Based**: All percentages based on actual code testing
2. **Consistent**: Single source of truth for each metric
3. **Actionable**: Clear next steps in TASKLIST.md
4. **Realistic**: Honest about problems and blockers
5. **Structured**: Clear hierarchy of documents

## ✅ Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Clarity**: Single source of truth for project status
2. **Focus**: Clear priorities in TASKLIST.md
3. **Honesty**: Realistic timeline expectations
4. **Actionable**: Developers know exactly what to work on
5. **Trackable**: Can measure real progress against real metrics

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Follow [TASKLIST.md](../../TASKLIST.md) to fix test compilation
2. Implement Milestone 0 (Observability) from [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md)
3. Update PROJECT_STATUS.md after each sprint
4. Keep documentation in sync with actual implementation

## 📝 Documentation Maintenance

Going forward:
- Update PROJECT_STATUS.md weekly
- Mark tasks complete in TASKLIST.md as finished
- Update ROADMAP.md milestone completion monthly
- Keep README.md badges accurate
- Archive old sprint reports to prevent confusion

---

**Result**: Documentation now accurately reflects the true state of the project, providing a solid foundation for continued development with realistic expectations.
