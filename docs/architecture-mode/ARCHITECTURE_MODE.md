# Architecture Mode Guardrails (Solo)

**Planning Mode (default)** — research → analyze → questions → options → warnings → decision.  
**Execution Mode** — only after explicit "go".

Rules:
- Planning is read-only. No code changes until "go".
- Always do quick research + repo scan.
- Offer 4–8 simple options with risks/assumptions.
- Switch back to planning after each execution chunk.
