## For Every Feature:

### ☐ Research Phase
- [ ] Used WebSearch for best practices
- [ ] Used WebFetch for documentation
- [ ] Saved research to .architecture/research/
- [ ] Identified 3+ relevant patterns

### ☐ Analysis Phase
- [ ] Used LS to explore structure
- [ ] Used Grep to find patterns
- [ ] Used Read for detailed review
- [ ] Documented integration points
- [ ] Saved to .architecture/analysis/

### ☐ Options Phase
- [ ] Generated exactly 4-8 options
- [ ] Each option has different approach
- [ ] Documented pros/cons for each
- [ ] Included complexity assessment
- [ ] Saved to .architecture/options/

### ☐ Selection Phase
- [ ] User selected specific option
- [ ] Documented selection rationale
- [ ] Saved to .architecture/decisions/

### ☐ Execution Phase
- [ ] Waited for "g" or "go" command
- [ ] Implemented selected option only
- [ ] Created tests for implementation
- [ ] Updated documentation
- [ ] Logged to .architecture/execution_logs/

## Red Flags (Fix Immediately):
