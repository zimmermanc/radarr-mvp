I'm working on the Radarr MVP project at /home/thetu/radarr-mvp using Architecture Mode.

## Architecture Mode Rules:
- PLANNING MODE by default (read-only)
- WebSearch + WebFetch required for research
- LS + Grep + Read required for analysis
- Must provide 4-8 solution options
- Cannot execute without "g" or "go" command
- User must select option before execution

## Current Status:
- Feature: [movie-management/release-parser/etc]
- Phase: [Research/Analysis/Options/Execution]
- Mode: [PLANNING/EXECUTION]
- Selected Option: [None/Option #X]

## Request:
[Your specific request here]

Please follow Architecture Mode structure:
1. If researching: Start with WebSearch and WebFetch
2. If analyzing: Use LS, Grep, and Read
3. If options: Generate 4-8 different approaches
4. If executing: Wait for my "g" command
