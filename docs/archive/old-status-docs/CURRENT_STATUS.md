### Component Communication
- **Event Bus**: Tokio broadcast channels for component communication
- **Queue System**: Background job processing with retry logic
- **Database Pool**: Async PostgreSQL connections with health checks
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation of concerns with repository pattern

## 🚀 Working Workflows

### 1. Movie Addition Workflow ✅
```
User adds movie → MovieAdded event → Search indexers → 
Download queued → QueueProcessor → qBittorrent download → 
DownloadComplete event → Import triggered → File processed → 
Library updated → User notified
```

### 2. RSS Monitoring Workflow ✅
```
RSS monitor → New release detected → Movie lookup → 
Search triggered → Download workflow (as above)
```

### 3. Import Workflow ✅
```
Download complete → File scanner → Quality analysis → 
Hardlink creation → Template rename → Library update → 
Database sync → Event notification
```
