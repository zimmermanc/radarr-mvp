## Key Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Organization
- ✅ Created clear folder structure (analysis, setup, archive)
- ✅ Moved 20+ documents to appropriate locations
- ✅ Archived outdated planning documents

### 2. Content Updates
- ✅ Updated README.md to show ~75% completion (reflecting Week 3 achievements)
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with current working features and deployment status
- ✅ Created CURRENT_STATUS.md with detailed component status
- ✅ Created RESUME_WORK.md with complete guidance for continuing development
- ✅ Updated PROGRESS.md with Week 3 implementation results

### 3. Truth vs Fiction
| Document | Previous State | Current State |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| README.md | "~45% Complete" | "~75% Complete" |
| CLAUDE.md | "~65% Complete" | "~75% Complete with production components" |
| Component Status | "Basic automation" | "HDBits, qBittorrent, Import Pipeline operational" |
| Timeline | "Week 1 complete" | "Week 3 complete, production deployment ready" |

## Week 3 Achievements Documented

1. **HDBits Integration Complete** - Scene group analysis and torrent search operational
2. **qBittorrent Client Functional** - Download management and progress tracking working
3. **Import Pipeline Operational** - File processing, hardlinking, and library integration
4. **Queue Processing Active** - Background job system with retry logic
5. **Event System Working** - Component communication via tokio broadcast channels

## Current Implementation Status

**Production Target Features**:
- Movie automation pipeline
- External service integration
- Download and import management
- Real-time progress tracking

**Rust MVP Current State**:
- ✅ Core automation pipeline functional
- ✅ HDBits integration with scene group analysis
- ✅ qBittorrent client with progress tracking
- ✅ Import pipeline with hardlinking and renaming
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with 15+ tables
- ✅ Event-driven architecture operational
- ✅ React UI with real-time updates

## Documentation Quality Metrics

| Metric | Status | Notes |
