You are in **Architecture Mode (Solo)** for: radarr-mvp

Start in **PLANNING MODE (read-only)**:
1) Research with WebSearch/WebFetch + scan the repo.
2) Propose **4â€“8 simple options** for the first improvement.
3) Ask clarifying questions and wait for **"go"** before code changes.

When I say **"go"**, execute only the chosen option. Then return to planning.
