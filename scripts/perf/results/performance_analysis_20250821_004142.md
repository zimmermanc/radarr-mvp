## Performance Assessment

### Current State Analysis

Based on the test results, the Radarr MVP application exhibits the following performance characteristics:

#### Response Time Analysis
- **Health Endpoint**: Primary test endpoint for basic functionality
- **API Endpoints**: Authentication-based endpoints requiring API key validation
- **Database Dependency**: Performance heavily tied to PostgreSQL connection pool

#### Observed Issues
1. **High Latency**: Response times significantly higher than target (<50ms)
2. **Timeout Issues**: Requests timing out under minimal load
3. **Resource Utilization**: Potential inefficiencies in request handling

### Root Cause Analysis

Potential performance bottlenecks identified:

1. **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**
   - Multiple idle PostgreSQL connections observed
   - Possible connection pool misconfiguration
   - Blocking on database operations

2. **Synchronous Request Processing**
   - Application may not be handling concurrent requests efficiently
   - Lack of proper async/await optimization in request handlers

3. **Resource Contention**
   - Memory usage patterns suggesting potential leaks
   - CPU utilization during load testing

### Performance Targets vs Actual

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| P95 Response Time | <100ms | >1000ms | ❌ FAIL |
| Throughput | >1000 req/s | <10 req/s | ❌ FAIL |
| Error Rate | <1% | Variable | ⚠️ REVIEW |
| Memory Usage | <200MB | TBD | ⚠️ REVIEW |

## Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Database Connection Pool Optimization**
   ```rust
   // Recommended configuration
   max_connections: 10,
   min_connections: 2,
   acquire_timeout: Duration::from_secs(10),
   idle_timeout: Duration::from_secs(600),
   ```

2. **Async Request Handler Review**
   - Audit all database operations for proper async/await usage
   - Implement connection pooling best practices
   - Add request timeout handling

3. **Memory Management**
   - Profile for memory leaks
   - Optimize JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Review large object allocations

### Medium-Term Improvements

1. **Caching Implementation**
   - Add Redis for frequently accessed data
   - Implement HTTP response caching
   - Cache database query results

2. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Add indexes for frequent queries
   - Optimize N+1 query patterns
   - Implement query result batching

3. **Load Balancing Preparation**
   - Stateless session management
   - Health check endpoints
   - Graceful shutdown handling

### Long-Term Architectural Changes

1. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Split heavy operations into separate services
   - Implement event-driven communication
   - Independent scaling capabilities

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - APM tool integration (e.g., Datadog, New Relic)
   - Custom metrics collection
   - Real-time alerting on performance degradation

## Testing Recommendations

### Continuous Performance Testing

1. **Automated Performance Tests**
   - Integrate k6 tests into CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up performance regression alerts
   - Regular load testing schedules

2. **Production Monitoring**
   - Real-time performance dashboards
   - Error rate monitoring
   - Resource utilization tracking

3. **Capacity Planning**
   - Define scaling thresholds
   - Document performance baselines
   - Plan for traffic growth

## Conclusion

The Radarr MVP application currently does not meet production performance requirements. The primary issues appear to be related to database connection handling and request processing efficiency.

**Priority Actions:**
1. Fix database connection pool configuration
2. Audit async/await implementation
3. Add basic performance monitoring
4. Implement timeout handling

**Success Criteria:**
- Achieve <100ms P95 response times
- Handle >100 concurrent users
- Maintain <1% error rate under normal load
- Use <500MB memory under load

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement immediate optimizations
2. Re-run performance tests
3. Set up continuous monitoring
4. Plan capacity scaling strategy
